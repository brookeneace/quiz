# Wine quiz

## Overview
This is a quiz with 5 questions, and the result gives the user a different type of wine based on their answers. The front end is done with Angular JS and javascript. The back end is done using mongo, mongoose, express, node. 

## Installation
In order to run this project, you'll need to have **npm, nodejs and monogodb** installed on your computer. 

1. Download or clone repo
2. In terminal, change directory to the location of the "quiz" folder
3. Run npm install to install any packages or dependencies needed for the project
4. Type "node index.js" in the terminal to get project running

## TO DO as of last commit
1. There is no validation on the quiz form which is something I would like to add if I had more time to make this more user friendly. 

2. I would also like to add a picture, and social share to the results to make this more  engaging for the user. 


## Other project notes 
NoSQL database and angular are completely new to me and I found this project both interesting and challenging. In the interest of getting this completed on time I did fall back on using vanilla javascript a little more than I wanted to (instead of angular) in the view portions.
